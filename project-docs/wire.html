                <p>
                    The Wire is an independent print and online music news magazine that covers alternative, underground
                    and non-mainstream music releases and events while spotlighting artists through essays and
                    interviews.

                <H2>Why The Wire?</H2>

            </div>

            <div class="intro-text">

                <p>
                    The redesign was for User Interface Design II, and the prompt was to redesign a news / magazine
                    website. The process started with researching every aspect of the site, understanding what worked
                    and what didn’t. A user persona was then built for the target audience of the magazine’s website.
                </p>

                <h2>The Audience:</h2>

            </div>


            <p>
                The target user is defined as being someone between the ages of 20-30, living in urban areas, getting a
                degree of higher education or recently graduated.
            </p>

            <img class="project-img" src="../graphics/wire/userpersona-edited.gif" alt="user-persona">

            <p>
                The target user has an interest in obscure pieces of art or music that intellectually stimulates them.
                They wish to learn more in jazz, modern, indie, and experimental music specifically, as this magazine is
                targeted for those genres.
            </p>

            <div class="body-h2">

                <h2>Research Sketches:</h2>

            </div>

            <p>
                The next part of the process was research sketches on potential design ideas. I wasn’t dead set on any
                of these, but they helped generate ideas for more important prototypes.
            </p>

            <img class="project-img" src="../graphics/wire/sketches1.gif" alt="sketches-1">

            <img class="project-img" src="../graphics/wire/sketches3.gif" alt="sketches-3">


            <p>
                Some ideas stood out more than others and were highlighted for later on in the process.
            </p>

            <div class="body-h2">

                <h2>Style Guide:</h2>

            </div>

            <p>The style guide consisted of color choices, font choices, and icon styles for this website.
            </p>

            <img class="project-img" src="../graphics/wire/colors.gif" alt="colors">

            <p>The color choices had to have some sort of sophistication, but still a more bright color pop, similar to
                the the magazine covers that they used. Both color palettes 2 and 3 were too bright and colorful for
                these sorts of text heavy pages, so the first color palette was the one I decided on. Also, the gold
                matched the high end standard that they hold themselves too.
            </p>

            <img class="project-img" src="../graphics/wire/fonts.gif" alt="fonts">

            <p>The font choices were designed to keep to that sophisticated style, along with a lot of copy text. The
                most readable font combination was style 2 and the font family had great cohesion.
            </p>

            <img class="project-img" src="../graphics/wire/icons.gif" alt="icons">

            <p>
                Lastly, the icons were styled with very minor differences, but the first option was chosen due to the
                drop shadow providing more clarity on the site.
            </p>

            <div class="body-h2">

                <h2>Final Product:</h2>

            </div>

            <p>
                All of the various pages are the final products for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens. They cover the
                home screen, menu tab, and the articles page. The full project with desktop and tablet sizes can be
