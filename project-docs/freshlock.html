                <p>
                    The average U.S. household wasted 31.9% of its food, costing families an additional $1,500+ every
                    year. Families with three or more children often had upwards of $1,800 in food waste every year.

                <h2>The Research:</h2>

            </div>

            <p>
                The question posed when tackling this project was how might we reduce the amount of food waste in large
                family households? In order to tackle this, some basic goals were set so we aimed to create a
                multi-media solution that helps large families produce less food waste so that families can save money
                while developing healthy shopping and kitchen habits. We know we are successful if it helps large
                families produce little to no food waste in areas of leftovers or produce.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our research consisted of a mix of first-hand and desk research. For the first hand research, we
                surveyed a small group of people and asked for information on how they stored their food, their shopping
                habits, and their knowledge of when foods go bad.
            </p>

            <img class="project-img" src="../graphics/freshlock/data-1.gif" alt="data-1">

            <p>
                Our data consisted of information on how much of their food goes bad, what food types go bad, if they
                lose track of expiration dates, if they purchase more food depending on deals, how they shop, where they
                shop, and whether or not they make a list or not. This lead us to make decisions that allow our design
                to provide solutions to these problems.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our desk research consisted of information on how much waste was produced in different family sizes,
                what foods go bad the most often, and where most of food waste comes from.
            </p>

            <img class="project-img" src="../graphics/freshlock/data-2.gif" alt="data-2">

            <p>
                The data urged us to understand the entire food waste process, so we could better see where our product
                could be most efficient.
            </p>

            <img class="project-img" src="../graphics/freshlock/j-map.gif" alt="journey-map">

            <p>
                When journey mapped, we discovered that the last stage of the food waste journey was where the most went
                wrong. When food sits in the fridge too long, leftovers (one of the largest contributors to food waste)
                go bad costing the family a potential meal or two. By tackling the problem of food waste in the fridge,
                we have the opportunity to provide a solution to the last stage of food waste. The multi-media aspect
                allows us to focus on other parts of the food waste timeline, such as shopping or cooking.

                <h2>The Ideations:</h2>

            </div>

            <p>
                The ideation stage consisted of ideas including food scanners, smart containers, smart fridges, handheld
                scanners and seals that changed color. Many of our ideas were based around reminding users that there
                food is still fresh, and letting them know what they can make with their food as time the time expires.
            </p>

            <img class="project-img" src="../graphics/freshlock/sketch-1.gif" alt="sketch-1">

            <p>
                Our iterations were building on the ideas of a smart container and app combination. We developed this
                until we came to our final solution.
            </p>

                <h2>The Final Solution:</h2>

            </div>

            <p>
                For our final solution, we came up with a multimedia solution which combines smart tupperware and phones
                to create a seamless experience for users to track leftovers in their fridge. This solves the issue of
                people forgetting about certain leftovers in their fridge, which eventually get thrown out. Overall, our
                solution will guide families into being more conscious about their food waste and save money by sending
                freshness reminders and preservation tips.
            </p>

            <img class="project-img" src="../graphics/freshlock/mock-2.gif" alt="mock-2">

            <p>
                The phone application was designed to display a list of containers that are still fresh, suggest ways to
                use the leftover food, promote better shopping behavior, remind users of leftover food.
            </p>

            <img class="project-img" src="../graphics/freshlock/mock-4.gif" alt="mock-4">

            <p>
                Our plan for prototyping users will be asked to keep track of when they fill their containers with
                leftovers. They will set reminders on their phones for 2 and 3 days later since there would be 2 and 1
                days left respectively to consume these leftovers. This process will test their reaction to phone
                reminders and reveal whether their food waste behavior improves.
            </p>

            <p>
                Users will also place sticky notes on each container and change the numbers daily to simulate the
                countdown timer on FRESHLOCK containers.

            </div>

            <p>
                This project helped me put design thinking techniques into practice. I built up my skills on journey
                mapping, rapid ideating and iterating, and the full double diamond process. The design thinking process
                has become a more guiding force in my workflow since it worked so well towards structuring this project.
