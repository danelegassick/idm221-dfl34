                    combination, track your stats, show off surfing highlights, and connect with others. Build crews of
                    surfers to compete with friends, or view the daily leaderboard for your beaches. Unite globally or

                <h2>The Idea:</h2>

            </div>

            <p>
                Pipeline’s development started from a place much further than where it ended. Originally, I was
                sketching out fun ideas to that came to my head. I thought about surfing and getting bored out when
                there is no waves, and decided that having games on your board would be pretty fun. What I sketched out
                was a mix of a Tesla and a normal surfboard.
            </p>

            <img class="project-img" src="../graphics/pipeline/sketch.gif" alt="sketch">

            <p>
                I developed this “surf-bored” idea a bit more with some statistic tracking. I felt that it would be
                important to view how your surfing and workout went. So I added a sensor to the bottom of the board and
                a leash that would track bpm, and calories burned. I thought that with an app, everything could be
                linked together for competition. That’s when I found my niche.
            </p>

                <h2>The Branding:</h2>

            </div>

            <p>
                With competition being a key part of the surfing community, I realized that the sensor tracking personal
                statistics was the way to go. An app would help create the community aspect, almost like Peloton. I then
                refined the idea to the sensor-app combination and began to brand.
            </p>

            <p>
                After going through logo after logo after logo, I decided that the brand had to be simple. Tech/social
                media companies generally keep their logos as their brand, with no words needed to describe it. See the
                images to watch the logo evolve over time.
            </p>

            <img class="project-img" src="../graphics/pipeline/logo-sketch-2.gif" alt="logo-sketch-2">

            <p>
                The colors were based on some old style surfing/beach ware that I felt would keep the brand away from
                the abundance of blue surfing apps online already.
            </p>

            <img class="project-img" src="../graphics/pipeline/logo.gif" alt="logo">

            <p>
                The last step was getting a name for the brand. I brainstormed with a few other people and went through
                all of the classic surf_______ and ______com ideas, then went to the internet for surfing locations.
                Pipeline. It’s the most well known surf spot in the world and no other surf companies had this name. It
                matched the community aspect that the app encouraged as well because of “lines” of communication.
            </p>

                <h2>How I'm Learning:</h2>

            </div>

            <p>
                This project was something I was super passionate about, so it was easy to work on. I decided that even
                if I am working on a project, that doesn’t mean much to me, I will convince myself that this is
                something I am passionate about. It’s definitely an odd process, but it has helped me get genuinely more
                invested in tons of other projects.
            </p>

            <p>
                Pipeline was also my first real work with logo design and branding. I had to think about what I wanted
                the company to represent, then what its aesthetic would be. Now this is very different from a redesign
                because it is something you have to decide, rather than analyze.
            </p>

            <p>
                Lastly, I learned how to develop and pitch a business. This was an extremely tedious process that took a
                few weeks, but it was super enjoyable. I understood that this business had to be feasible, desirable,
                viable, sustainable, and ethical. Technically, a business can just survive with the first three values,
                however I don’t believe that an unethical business is a good one. Also, sustainability is in reference
                to not only the labor behind the company, but also making sure that this business sticks around and
                adapts to the competitive environment.
