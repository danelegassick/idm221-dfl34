                    Elevate is a productivity and focus app that helps people beat their phone addiction and elevate
                    their time management in an interesting and pleasant way. Users can earn credits by not using their
                    cell phones and help build real infrastructure around the world with the credits.

            <div class="intro-text">

                <p>
                    The user persona was the first part of the process. The app is built for both students and people
                    working remotely. The target audience ranges anywhere from ages 15-30. People younger than 30 often
                    have more issues staying off of their phone and students often fit into this age range.
                    Psychologically, these people either struggle with attention span or anxiety regarding task
                    management.

                <h2>User Tasks:</h2>

            </div>

            <p>
                Next was to define the user tasks. Upon loading in to the app, the user is immediately greeted with the
                main product, a timer. It can be adjusted using the slider on the side which determines the length of
                time and size of building.
            </p>

            <p>
                Upon stating the timer, the user will be locked in the app until completion, otherwise the building will
                fail to complete. Once the building either completes or fails, the user will be brought to the overview
                page. Here, they will be able to view statistics regarding their focus and what their city looks like,
                based on how many tasks they have failed of completed.
            </p>

            <p>
                From the overview page, the user can continue on to the Real Build page which allows them to use in app
                currency to donate real money to developing communities infrastructure funds.

            <p>
                The style choices were designed to create a calm feeling, with enough contrast to have strong
                silhouettes. The orange and blue color palette was selected, but a lot of changes were applied to make
                it more cohesive. Blue was designed to be calming, and orange designed to be eye catching and
                contrasting from the darker colors.

                <h2>IX Flow + Interaction Guide:</h2>

            </div>

            <p>
                The IX Flow worked through how a user would go through the main functions of the app, ending at a
                donation screen. The route has a few off chutes that all still lead to their results page. That screen
                should be prioritized after starting the main timer function.
            </p>

            <img class="project-img" src="../graphics/elevate/ixflow.gif" alt="ixflow">

            <p>
                The interaction guide then worked out the motion of all of the micro-animations for the project. This
                ranged from sliding animations, to full page shifts, trying to seamlessly connect all of the pages and
                pieces together.
            </p>

            <img class="project-img" src="../graphics/elevate/interaction-guide.gif" alt="interaction-guide">

            <p>
                This was then taken into Adobe After Effects to animate. The assets were imported from Figma and entered
                into AE to be keyframed. The final animation featured a hovering dot to show where the user would be
                tapping on the screen.
