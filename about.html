                    <p class="top">My name is Dane LeGassick. Iâ€™m currently a second-year student attending Drexel
                        University studying user experience interaction design. I have just now moved to Philly due to
                        the pandemic so I for the last year I had been living in LA and NYC. I grew up in Santa Clarita,
                        a suburb north of LA, so it has been a lot to adjust to. I love to surf, game, and play
                        volleyball during my free time (and have gotten significantly better at all of these throughout
                        quarantine).</p>

                    <p>Before I had any design experience, I was dead set on becoming an engineer. I was above average
                        at math and science and making things was always so much fun for me. Throughout all of high
                        school, I had assumed this was the perfect career path for me all the way up until I started
                        applying for college. Then I toured an engineering lab. It was so boring compared to what I had
                        made it up to be, and I had no time to figure out what I really enjoyed. As I continued through
                        the college process, I set up a website to harbor all of the projects I had made and worked on
                        over the past few years. After working everyday, I realized that I was enjoying spending hours
                        everyday building this site. I would blow off anything I had going on that day just so that I
                        could keep designing this site. So I fell in love with that design process, and here we are now.
                    </p>

                    <p>Since then I have worked with UI and UX design in my college courses, while studying 3D modeling
                        techniques in my freetime. In the past, I have also done some work with face filters, python
                        mini-projects, and after effects animations. Digital media has always been a place where I can
                        experiment and grow as a designer because there is so much inspiration everywhere online. </p>

                    <h2>Inspirations</h2>

                    <p>Some of my biggest inspirations are awwwards.com for websites (because everyday they have
                        something new and incredible), Max Joseph (known as the assistant from the show Catfish), and
                        Takashi Murakami (because his work is just so much fun). I have plenty of other people that have
                        inspired me over the years but these have been constant over the past few.</p>
